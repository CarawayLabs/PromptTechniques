# PromptTechniques: An Introduction to Large Language Model Prompting

## Overview

Welcome to **PromptTechniques**, a hands-on course designed to introduce software engineers to the art and science of prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). While this course is tailored for those new to LLM prompting, it assumes a basic familiarity with Python. 

We will predominantly focus on **ChatGPT**, a well-known LLM, to illustrate various prompt techniques and best practices. Although we use Python for code examples, the principles taught here are agnostic to the programming language and can be applied when interacting with LLMs through various mediums, including APIs and GUIs.

## Topics Covered

- **Best Practices**: Learn the do's and don'ts of prompting LLMs.
- **Roles**: Understand the key roles that contribute to effective prompting.
- **Formatting Output**: Techniques for obtaining cleaner and more useful output.
- **Summarization**: Learn how to make LLMs summarize text efficiently.
- **Inference**: Get insights on how to perform inference with LLMs.
- **Prompt Techniques & Theories**: Explore a range of prompting strategies.

## Companion Material

The crux of the course is covered in [`PromptTechniques.MD`](PromptTechniques.md), which is supplemented with Jupyter notebooks to offer practical exercises. To run the notebooks, you can use any platform that supports Jupyter Notebooks. We recommend Visual Studio Code for an integrated experience.

### How to Run Code Samples

1. Install Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to interact with the OpenAI API using Python.

**Note**: Basic Python experience is beneficial but not mandatory.
